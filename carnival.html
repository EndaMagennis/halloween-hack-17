        <p>
        The air was electric, and the night was alive with the vibrant colors and twinkling lights of the carnival. The Carnival of Enigmas had rolled into town, setting up its whimsical world of wonders, merriment, and mysteries. 
        Nestled beneath the starlit sky, the carnival was a kaleidoscope of rides, games, and amusements, attracting visitors from far and wide. But beneath the laughter and excitement that echoed through the neon-lit alleyways, a dark cloud loomed. 
        An unsettling murmur had spread like wildfire among the carnival-goers. It was whispered that something sinister had occurred during the carnival's grand opening night. The enigmatic Carnival Organizer Olivia, who had once been the 
        charismatic heart of the show, had been found lifeless within the confines of the grand arena. The colorful carnival suddenly bore the weight of a chilling mystery, and the atmosphere shifted from one of joy to an unsettling 
        sense of intrigue and suspicion.It was a night that began with cotton candy dreams and ended with an eerie twist of fate. The question that haunted every visitor was, "Who could have committed this heinous act?" The list of potential 
        culprits included the carnival's peculiar cast of characters, each with their own secrets and motives. And what about the weapons? From magic wands to juggling pins, each held the potential to be the instrument of Carnival Organizer Olivia's untimely demise.
        As the moon hung low in the sky, an amateur sleuth emerged from the crowd, determined to unravel the carnival's most enigmatic mystery. The Carnival of Enigmas would no longer be a place of pure amusement but a carnival of secrets and suspicion.
        Now, it's up to you to solve the twisted puzzle that has gripped the carnival in fear. The stage is set, the suspects are in place, and the game of Deaths Veil begins. May your detective skills shine 
        amidst the neon glow, for the truth lies hidden within the colorful chaos of the carnival's darkest corners.</p>

            <h2>Clues</h2>
            <p>In this intriguing mini-game, you are presented with two choices to aid in your detective 
                journey. Let's unravel the options:

                1. "It Definitely Was Not" Clue:
                
                Choose this option, and you'll receive valuable information for eliminating suspects. 
                After clicking "Submit," the game code will reveal three items : a character, a weapon, 
                and a scene. These are not the correct choices for the mystery. 
                They can be confidently eliminated as potential suspects. 
                Use this clue to sharpen your focus and remove false leads.
                
                2. "It Might Have Been" Clue:
                
                Opt for this intriguing clue, and you'll receive a mixed bag of possibilities. 
                After clicking "Submit," the game code will provide three items : one is the right answer,
                and the other two are incorrect. It's your job to distinguish the true solution from the 
                red herrings. Analyze the options carefully, apply your detective skills, 
                and decide which one is correct.</p>
